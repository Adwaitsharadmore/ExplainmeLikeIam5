      - storyPages: An array of 5 short paragraphs (one per page)
      - exercisePrompts: An array of 4 simple physical activities tied to the story
      
      Keep each page 1-2 sentences. Make exercises fun, simple, and tied to story events.
      For example: "jump like a frog", "stretch tall like a tree", "tiptoe quietly".
      
      The story should have a beginning, middle challenge, and happy ending.
